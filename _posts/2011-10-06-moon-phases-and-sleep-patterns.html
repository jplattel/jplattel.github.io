<p>Even before I got a Zeo, I was wondering if the phases of the moon are of influence of my sleep quality. With <a href="http://myzeo.com">the Zeo</a> that offers an API, I finally had a chance to investigate. As it turns out after four months of experimenting: the phase of the moon doesn't have any influence on my sleep quality or the time it takes to fall asleep.</p>
<p>I've been building my own interface for the Zeo, because the flash based website doesn't suit my needs, here's a small screenshot:<br />

<p>I plan on rebuilding this on Django, but I'm currently having trouble with MySQL bindings on python... The building of the bindings produces lots of errors. If I can't get it done, maybe I'll have a try at <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.</p>
