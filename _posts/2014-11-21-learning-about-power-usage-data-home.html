<p>I recently moved to a new home, and I got a freshly installed new electricity meter that's a little bit more intelligent. It was now possible for me to sign up for <a href="http://slimmemeterportal.nl">slimmemeterportal.nl</a>, that let's you access the power-usage data from the meter by a 15 minute window. That's quite some data to play with!</p>
<p>Being interested in the data, I wrote a little scraper that collects it for me and stores it in a SQL database, from there on, with Flask and Peewee it was quite simple to create a little API for my own dataset. Currently I'm playing with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">react.js</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a> to learn them both a bit and explore what it possible. Here's one of the first graphs:<br />
<a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/power-usage-graph.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3140" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/power-usage-graph-1024x262.png" alt="Power Usage of my own home over the past 9 days" width="620" height="158" /></a>I've put <a href="https://github.com/jplattel/smp-scraper">the scraper-code on Github</a> for everyone to use! I suggest if you want to liberate your data, that's the way to go!</p>
<p>What I want to do? We'll there are several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossfilter the data to pick up any interesting data points.</li>
<li>Explore machine learning if I can predict my power-usage more</li>
<li>Find correlations based on temperature, activities or weather</li>
<li>What are those mystery peaks during the night?</li>
</ul>
