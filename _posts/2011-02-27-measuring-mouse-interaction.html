<p>I am an avid user of shortcuts and like to improve my workflow and I would like to discover hidden patterns. This is what happens next. When I bought my Mac 2 months ago I dumped my mouse in favor of the trackpad. Did this influence my mouse/trackpad interaction? Sadly I can't draw any conclusions about it because I switched my operating system too!</p>
<p>However more recently I started using MacLogger and together with <a href="http://gedachtes.van.jelleakkerman.nl/">Jelle</a> I've made some custom python and processing scripts that should offer more insight into my mouse usage. When I showed the screenshot below to Jelle he noticed I don't use my dock, as there are almost no points of rest at the side or bottom.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1897" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Mouse patterns modified in processing, colors don&#39;t represent any data"]<a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/background7.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1897" title="mouse patterns" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/background7-1024x640.png" alt="mouse patterns in processing" width="640" height="400" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I can confirm this because I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> to launch everything. Another interesting point is the usage of the Omnibox which is related to my Google Chrome usage. I didn't know the shortcut 'cmd + L' to select the omnibox yet. Let's see if I run the test again in a month if this has improved. An afternoon also yields the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>68805 total mouse movements.</li>
<li>45831 movements shorter as 10px.</li>
<li>22942 movements longer as 10px and shorter as 200px.</li>
<li>31 movements longer as 200px.</li>
<li>791346px total distance (somewhere around 10px/second/day).</li>
</ul>
<p>I use the trackpad/mouse for mostly smaller movements. Is it possible to let is auto-snap to certain things?</p>
<p>I am aware there is software which makes nice graphics etc, but I like my data raw and <a href="https://github.com/andrewschaaf/MacLogger">MacLogger happily provides it</a>!</p>
