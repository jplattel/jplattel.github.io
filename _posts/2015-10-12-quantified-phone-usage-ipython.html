<p>Technology is making it easier to collect data, for example phone usage. From the 1st of January I tracked how much I've used my phone by installing an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-track-how-much-you/id771541926?mt=8">Moment</a>. It runs in the background and silently tracks how much you use your phone. As said, the first step towards behaviour-change is providing insight in current behaviour. </p>
<p>Lately I've been exploring iPython for data-analysis and sharing snippets of data. I've started a Github <a href="https://github.com/jplattel/notebooks">repository</a> that contains some notebooks I'm working on. And I've embedded the one below where I analyse my phone usage:<!--more--></p>

<p>I'd like iPython notebooks for their portability and it makes it easy to document code along with mark-down. It's somewhere in between a 'gist' and a full github repository. I've created a special post-template within Wordpress that should make it easy to share more notebooks, so you should be expecting more to pop up when I tend to share code! </p>
<p>Regarding changing behaviour, I think creating this analysis made me aware that I spend over 1 hour everyday behind my phone, that's a lot. Including quantifying sleep and computer time, I do think it's possible to create quite a good framework of my days. Such a framework can be the first steps towards a method for personal behaviour change...</p>
