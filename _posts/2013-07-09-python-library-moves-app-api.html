<p>For Quantified Self starters I recommend the really nice <a href="https://moves-app.com/">Moves App</a>. The interface is really nice and the battery drain isn't that bad if you recharge it twice a day. They recently <a href="http://dev.moves-app.com">opened up their API enabling developers</a> like me to create apps based on their platform. For me the first step towards creating an app is a easier way to communicate with the API.</p>

<p>As with the fitbit, I've written a open-source library for you to use! It's available trough <a href="https://github.com/jplattel/PyMoves">Github</a>. If you want to improve my code, feel free to fork me! I will use this library for creating a website which let's you export all data from Moves more easily. Because freedom of data is important, getting it out is the first step.</p>
