<p>Being in de United States is a perfect excuse for visiting my brother! After enjoying a 5 hour flight (with wifi!) and a delayed subway ride: here's the two of us before the skyline of New York City:<br />
<a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/0c0a30ae346a11e3bc2722000a1faee5_8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2860" alt="Kees and Joost" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/0c0a30ae346a11e3bc2722000a1faee5_8.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a> I've had 8 days to explore the city, mostly by foot and metro. The first I found the most enjoyable, while the latter turned out to be faster most of the time. At least I walked all three off the main bridges to Manhatten and strolled trough Central Park and The Highline:<br />
<a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0750.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2858" alt="The Highline" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_0750-764x1024.jpg" width="620" height="830" /></a> The food, the views, the people, the beer & whisky... Ah well. New York has been good on me! For sure I'm gonna visit it again! </p>
