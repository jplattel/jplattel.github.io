  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: The Fitbit (affiliate link) is one of the best tools for
    activity tracking. But there isn't a dashboard for groups available. That's what
    I'm building now.

<p>The <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> (<a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=286239&amp;u=759744&amp;m=31379&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">affiliate link</a>) is one of the best tools for activity tracking.The interface is nice and the hardware is durable and syncs wirelessly. For a personal level is good, but using group-wise or equipping all employees with a Fitbit turns out to be non-existent.</p>
<p>During the past few days I've spend some time building a dashboard that lets people see the data from all users within a group. It gets all data trough the Fitbit API and summarizes it into a view per day/week/month. Next to that I also plan to provide leaderboards, custom graphs and statistics. Here's a screenshot of the app so far:</p>

<p>A dashboard like this is possibly useful for elderly care homes or organisations that are interested in their employees activity and health. If you have other ideas where this could find a platform, let me know in the comments!</p>
