<p>I love the <a href="http://www.readitlaterlist.com/">Read It Later List</a> service. Each day I save about 20-30 articles from Google Reader or my Twitter client so I can read them later. However, these amounts make it hard for me to process all the things I save. That's why I need a readinglist that has additional filtering/speed/shortcuts.</p>
<p>As my endeavors with Python continue, for the last few months I've been developing my own version of the perfect readinglist build upon the <a href="http://www.readitlaterlist.com/api/">API of Read It Later List</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2021" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Full screen interface for better overview and a never-ending list of articles, all color-coded by tags.

<p>The name for the project is <strong>Readledo</strong>. And as you've seen in the screenshot, I've added some handy things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts and navigation ((used for adding tags, opening or sending links))</li>
<li>Sorting by tags</li>
<li>Color-coded tagging ((visual feedback is quicker))</li>
<li>Integration with Toodledo, Radbox and more ((based upon access trough email instead of API's because I'm having trouble with OAuth)).</li>
<li>(still in development, batch processing)</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is still in development, but I'm going to open-source it through Github once the code has been improved. In the mean time, do you have any other suggestions that would make a better readinglist?</p>
