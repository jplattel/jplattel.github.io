<p>I made a small visit to Paris at the start of November and I had the opportunity to visit the Lab Store. I've read about the concept in a book called The Lab that I've bought during my first visit to San Francisco. It's just pure luck that I come across that book in a little bookstore, but it feels like the adventure is just about to start..</p>
<p>While visiting <a href="http://labstore-paris.com">the Lab Store</a> I had to buy one of the Le Whaf's. It's sold out in the webstore, but I'm just too much into chemistry and cooking to let it go. Here is it in action:</p>

<p>Now, I just need some time to calibrate my sous-vide rice cooker:</p>
