<p>Like last year, I made a small video of all my <a href="http://jplattel.nl/836pm">8:36pm photos</a>. With a bit of help from <a href="http://ikbenke.es">my brother</a>, I managed to get everything into after effects and put it together. Let the nostalgia commence:</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/84538247" height="320" width="600" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back in a glance, the things I notice are: less computer work, more socializing and the increment in the amount of beverages and food photos. Next to that, I failed keeping up this year and missed a lot of photos. Sometimes for a reason (no internet or phone), while on other dates I simply seem to forget. My goal for this year is to decrease the time from taking a photo and uploading it.</p>
