<p><a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/18947c816263d7c48697c70d2df8cdff.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1943" title="Anatomy Drawing made in 1902" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/18947c816263d7c48697c70d2df8cdff-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I'll figured out to publish this, not only for my archives, but also to share some insight into the data that a person could generate. Have a look at the things I'm tracking to function as an archive or feedback loop. If I have some more time, I'll explain the things I use to make this all possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance travelled (which cities did I visit?)</li>
<li>Which people do I meet everyday?</li>
<li>What projects did I work on? And how much time?</li>
<li>How much work got done? (productivity, scale 1-10)</li>
<li>How do I physically and mentally? (1-10 scale for both)</li>
<li>Top 5 of nice and bad things that happend today</li>
<li>General rate of the day (1-10 scale)</li>
<li>How much coffee, tea, water etc did I drink (no other food tracking yet)</li>
<li>Did I exercise? Is the activity logged by Runkeeper? (speed &amp; GPS)</li>
<li>Dreams (not quite everyday but interesting as I'm exploring lucid dreaming)</li>
<li>How many hours did I sleep (and how well rested am I each morning?)</li>
<li>Take a picture everyday at 8:36pm</li>
<li>Daily photo of myself with the Everyday App</li>
<li>Reading patterns (mashup through Read It Later list)</li>
<li>Software usage with Rescue Time &amp; Wakoopa</li>
<li>Casually I track my mouse patterns with MacLogger</li>
<li>Lifelapses (only on special events)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px;">In addition there are other data-stream which can be used for data collection:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter/facebook updates, these contain a lot of useful data, but also much noise</li>
<li>Foursquare (really nice to have an archive!)</li>
<li>OV-chipkaart (used for public transport in The Netherlands much like the Oyster-card)</li>
<li>Payment transactions (Not able yet to transform this to any useful information, but should be shortly)</li>
<li>Calendar (not used, but lots of information in it!)</li>
<li>Blogposts or other online material like photos with EXIF-data.\</li>
<li>Email (text-analysis, mail-count, etc. can be a nice set of data)</li>
</ul>
<p>And I tried some temporary things to explore, but are discontinued because it takes too much time or effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>750words (I'm not a writer, but a data person)</li>
<li>GPS-broadcasting (every 3 minutes, including a live update header that shows my location on my blog)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I still would like to try but are to expensive for me at the moment of writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zeo (analyzing sleep together with my dream journal)</li>
<li>FitBit to get some activity patterns</li>
<li>Get my genome analyzed by 23andme</li>
</ul>
