  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: I've build a scraper-script so it easy to export all photos
    from Mobypicture tied to a specific account. This way you still own the photos
    that are uploaded.

<p><a href="http://www.mobypicture.com"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1962" title="mobypicture-logo-new-200px" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mobypicture-logo-new-200px.png" width="200" height="59" /></a>I love <a href="http://www.mobypicture.com/">Mobypicture</a>. It's the service I use to post my pictures onto Twitter, Flickr and Facebook. It makes uploading photos from my mobile phone as simple as it could possibly be. Even better, the service is free to use, unlike Flickr which only allows access to last 200 images if you go with their freemium model. But sadly using Mobypicture isn't without downsides. There is no export functionality as of yet.</p>
<p>So I decided to roll my own with Python and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>. And behold, within an hour I had a fully functional script exporting all my pictures from my old account. The code isn't the prettiest or the quickest, but is does it job fairly well. If you are looking to export all pictures from your Mobypicture account, you can use my script. It does require you to have python installed with the BeautifulSoup module.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/scraper3.zip">download</a> the script, navigate to it with the terminal and simply run the script as:</p>
<p><code>python scraper.py put_your_username_here</code></p>
<p>I've also made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/912685">gist from the script</a>, so you can check the code! If something goes wrong, let me know in the comments. It could be Mobypicture that changed the layout so the parser doesn't work anymore..</p>
<p><strong>[edit: Due to the relative time that mobypicture the first filenames don't appear correct, but the export works]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[edit: Here's an updated script that works with their API: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jplattel/8181849">https://gist.github.com/jplattel/8181849</a>]</strong></p>
