<p><a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_2559.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2043 alignright" title="Joost @ Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_2559-300x300.jpg" alt="Joost @ Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco" width="300" height="300" /></a> On the 25th of may my trip started with a 11 hour long flight straight <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/amerika/">to San Francisco to visit the Quantified Self Conference</a> in Mountain View. The trip was funded by donations, ideas and people.</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/resourcerer">Martijn Aslander</a> I've spent the first few days as a tourist and visited most of the spots that represent San Francisco. Then we boarded the Caltrain for Mountain View.</p>
<p>I volunteered at the the conference which brought me way more then being just there as a guest. I met a lot of wonderful and amazing people that would understand your point of view and knowledge about the Quantified Self. I may write a separate blogpost about the conference but there are great writeups <a href="http://qswiki.com/index.php/QS_Conference_2011">by</a> <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/31/highlights-of-the-first-quantified-self-conference/">other</a> <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/category/quantified-self-2011/">people</a>.</p>
<p>The day after the conference we took a short tour past Apple, Google &amp; LinkedIn, took the Caltrain back and explored the center of San Francisco, ending with a diner at the <a href="http://www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/top_of_the_mark/">Top of the Mark</a>, a magnificent view!</p>
<p>Tuesday we visited Berkeley, to visit <a href="http://aether.com/">Gary Wolf</a> and spend some time shopping for gadgets that had been on our wishlist. We had our last diner in SF together with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/evarijser">Eva Rijser</a> who arranged space for us during the first two days.</p>
<p>And on wednesday we had a quick breakfast before taking the BART to the airport once again. Jetlag got me once, but luckily the recovery went quite well.</p>
<p>In summary: I loved San Francisco! And a big thank you to <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/amerika/">all the people that made this trip possible</a>! I'm gonna build somekind of report just like Nicholas Felton did but just about the visit to the US.</p>
