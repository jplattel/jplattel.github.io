<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Joost Plattel</strong>, a data strategist, founder and speaker.</p>

<p>I like to do experiments and explore technological boundaries. When I'm not gathering information and data, I like to saunter to empty my mind.</p>

<p>I give <a href="/speaking/">talks</a> about the Quantified Self and code open-source software and data visualisations and dashboards. I run a startup called Qount.us which focuses on personal analytics at work.<p>

<p>I also explore creative uses of data together with my <a href="http://ikbenke.es/">twin</a> under the name <a href="http://thoughtkinetics.com">Thought Kinetics</a>.</p>

<p>Other interests of mine including 3D printing, electronics, science fiction, singularity, transhumanism, biotechnology and fermentation processes.</p>

<p>Interested in what kind of projects I'm working on other than the Quantified Self or which companies have hired me? Have a look at my more <a href="/projects/">recent projects</a>.</p>

<p>If you have something that would be interesting to me or if you want to share something, you should <a href="/contact/">drink a cup of delicious coffee</a> with me!</p>
