<p>I finally got myself a proper kettle for brewing beer. It's a modified Weck kettle that is normally used for the wecking process. </p>

<p>The idea started last year when I started brewing with Martijn from Bentrotsch. </p>

<p>Future modifications might be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A more sturdy plumbing system, copper, to retain heat and make it more easy to isolate, instead of the cheap plastic. Also required for the next item on this list:</li>
	<li>A pump for circulating the wort, this should also make filtering easier.</li>
	<li>A PID controller for temperature control. Since the thermostat that build into the kettle can vary more than 10 degrees Celcius!</li>
</ul>
