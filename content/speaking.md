  I'm often asked for a lecture or as a public speaker on topics like the Quantified Self, privacy & ethics and the democratization with technology. The length varies, depending on the time available I'm able to accommodate ideas in 10 minutes, or an in-depth view of the field in 45 minutes or more.

Covering over 100 different pages guarantees at least 1 should be interesting!
