<p>
  I'm often asked for a lecture or as a public speaker on topics like the Quantified Self, data, the Internet of Things and any related fields. If you're curious about the content, have a look at my slides on <a href="http://slideshare.net/jsplattel">Slideshare</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/63226010">look at the video from my talk at Cross Media Cafe</a>. The length varies, depending on the time available I'm able to accommodate ideas in 10 minutes, or an in-depth view of the field in 45 minutes or more.
