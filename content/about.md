I’m Joost Plattel, **a data-strategist**. I help organizations and individuals develop and build strategies for data-related questions and opportunities.  I connect API's, work with large datasets, models or visualizations. All to solve questions, discover patterns or explore new opportunities. 

The main question I wonder about is:

> How do we turn all the data we have available into information, to knowledge and finally wisdom? And can we use it for good?

My [clients](/client) range from individuals to startups and even the government or large organizations. People recommend my for my unique combination of curiousity with applied solutions. Wondering what else I do? Have a look at my other [projects](/projects). 

In my other time I run my mostly monthly newsletter, [The Curious Corner of the Internet](https://curiouscorner.nl) and our small brewery [Brouwerij Nooitgedacht](http://brouwerijnooitgedacht.nl/) with friends.</a>

## Work with me

If you (or your organization) want to explore the possiblities of working together [get in touch](/contact) with me. People recommend me for my unique combination of curiousity and applied solutions. 

Most of the work I do consists of consulting and/or development. In the case of consulting, my curiousity and wide network provides me with a wide variety of solutions. When developing a technical solution for a client my preferred tools are Python / Django / Jupyter and platforms like AWS or Serverless.

On a sidenote, I reserve at most 2 days a week for a single client. This allows for enough cross-overs to keep things fresh and evolving.
