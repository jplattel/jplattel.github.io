I’m Joost Plattel, **a data-strategist**. I help organizations and individuals develop and build strategies for data-related questions and opportunities.  I connect API's, work with large datasets, models or visualizations. All to solve questions, discover patterns or explore new opportunities. 

The main question I wonder about is:

> How do we turn all the data we have available into information, to knowledge and finally wisdom? And can we use it for good?

My [clients](/client) range from individuals to startups and even the government or large organizations. People recommend my for my unique combination of curiousity with applied solutions. Wondering what else I do? Have a look at my other [projects](/projects). 

In my other time I run my mostly monthly newsletter, [The Curious Corner of the Internet](https://curiouscorner.nl) and our small brewery [Brouwerij Nooitgedacht](http://brouwerijnooitgedacht.nl/) with friends.</a>
