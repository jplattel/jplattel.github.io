# About

I’m __Joost Plattel__, a data-strategist. I help organizations and individuals develop and build strategies for data-related questions and opportunities. <br />I connect _API's_, work with _large datasets, models or visualizations_. All to solve these questions, discover patterns or explore new opportunities. 

The main question I try to answer is:

> How do we turn all the data we have available into information, to knowledge and finally wisdom. Can we use if for good?

My clients range from startups to the government, large organisations or individuals. People recommend my for my unique combination of curiousity with applied solutions. Wondering what else I do? Have a look at my other [projects](/projects) I run and subscribe to [my mostly monthly newsletter](https://curiouscorner.nl)</a>!

# As a speaker

![](/img/speaking.jpg)

I'm often asked for a lecture or as a public speaker on topics like the Quantified Self, privacy & ethics and the democratization with technology. The length varies, depending on the time available I'm able to accommodate ideas in 10 minutes, or an in-depth view of the field in 45 minutes or more.

Next to speaking about certain topics within technology. I also offer a burst of enthusiasm and inspiration based on my newsletter, just randomly dropping [curious corners of the web](https://curiouscorner.nl) in the space of 1 hour.
