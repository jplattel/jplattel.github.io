My quest of building API wrappers in python continues with the FitBit. The handy devices tracks most of my activities and movements during daytime. So it's an excellent self-tracking device, especially with the wireless sync. There wasn't an API interface available in python, so with some [borrowed code](https://groups.google.com/group/fitbit-api/browse_thread/thread/0a45d0ebed3ebccb) I decided to build my own.

I made an [GitHub repository with the code and an example for you to use](https://github.com/jplattel/FitBit.py).Â Please fork and correct any changes that you think would be useful for me to learn! Also let me know where your using it, I would really like to know ;-).
