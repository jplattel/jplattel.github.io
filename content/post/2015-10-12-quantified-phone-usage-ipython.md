Technology is making it easier to collect data, for example phone usage. From the 1st of January I tracked how much I've used my phone by installing an app called [Moment](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-track-how-much-you/id771541926?mt=8). It runs in the background and silently tracks how much you use your phone. As said, the first step towards behaviour-change is providing insight in current behaviour.

Lately I've been exploring iPython for data-analysis and sharing snippets of data. I've started a Github [repository](https://github.com/jplattel/notebooks) that contains some notebooks I'm working on.

I'd like iPython notebooks for their portability and it makes it easy to document code along with mark-down. It's somewhere in between a 'gist' and a full github repository. I've created a special post-template within Wordpress that should make it easy to share more notebooks, so you should be expecting more to pop up when I tend to share code!

Regarding changing behaviour, I think creating this analysis made me aware that I spend over 1 hour everyday behind my phone, that's a lot. Including quantifying sleep and computer time, I do think it's possible to create quite a good framework of my days. Such a framework can be the first steps towards a method for personal behaviour change...
