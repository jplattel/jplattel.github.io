I have been thinking about the bandwidth problem we face with computer interaces. When typing with a keyboard or dictating trough speech, the computer cannot keep up with a stream of thoughts. Our bandwidth is limited by our output.

One of the more future forwards solutions is [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/), but to me it seems like quite an invasive solution, not without any risks..

Often times we may find solutions for this in a different space, in this case, a pointer can be found in the legal system. During a lawsuit a minute taker (sometimes even multiple) is the person who tries to log all the speech done by any of the parties present. The typing speed required for this is immense and one of the solutions is combining shorthand or stenography with a chorded keyboard. This results in a higher output speed allowing the minute taker to keep up with the tempo of speech.

Journalists also are solving this problem with stenography or dictation at a asynchronous speed (ie: transcribing later). However stenography is often personal and very limited in the way it can be integrated in software, as it's often too much configuration.

This leaves the chorded keyboard as the main point of solving this problem and one I'd like to explore further by developing my own wearable keyboard. Another tip I got from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jplattel/status/1348735510806745091) was to look into braille keyboards..

Typing blindly while looking at my surroundings and allowing me to input text towards my iPhone or and SD-card for asynchronous processing would be wonderful! In the next post I'll show a few photos of the prototype I've been working on!
