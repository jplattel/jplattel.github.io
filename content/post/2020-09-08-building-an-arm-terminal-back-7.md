For long I've been inspired by future interfaces commonly seen in science fiction movies and other things like comics or concept art. I've been following the [Cyberdeck reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/) for some time and when I came accross the [ARM Terminal by Back7](https://back7.co/home/arm-terminal) I knew I had to build one..

Fast forward a few months and one 3D printer later, I've managed to print most of the parts _(For smaller printers like the Prusa Mini I have it's better to split the bigger parts and glue them together later with superglue)_. After the shipment of parts & screen came in, I started the assembly and it currently looks like this:

The original one has a spectrum analyzer at the bottom, but instead I wanted something else that would allow me to use custom keys, thus I designed a mountable keyboard for on the bottom:

As for the side, maybe I'll replace the momentary switch with a rotary encoder for controlling for example the volume. Or add a set of front-side connectors for USB and micro-sd cards. The original design allows for more then enough flexibility!

If you also want to have the 3D files for the keyboard, have a look at the [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4591494) page for it!
