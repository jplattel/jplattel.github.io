<p>I really don't like shopping for groceries and I developed the habit to forget half of my groceries.... A digital grocery list would be perfect.... shortly after discussing todo-lists with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/resourcerer">Martijn Aslander</a> I was inspired to build a mashup to solve my problem.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Image.png" alt="" title="Image" width="540" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1670" /></p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/geotracking-streaming-gps-locations/">information gathered</a> by <a href="http://instamapper.com/">Instamapper</a> in combination with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a> it is possible to calcuate the distance between two points on a sphere. When the distance is small enough a push notification including a link to my digital grocery list is send to my iPhone <a href="https://api.notifo.com/">trough the Notifo API</a>. My knowledge of python and App Engine is slowly growing and these kind of mashups are great exercises!</p>
<p>The mashup includes an admin area where grocery stores and other locations can be added and edited. This way it is easy to modify the notifications. I also added the option to specify the radius so you can configure distance at which a push notification would be send.</p>
<p>All location-based mashups gathering information from Instamapper together will be named <a href="http://mappedlife.appspot.com/">Mappedlife</a>. I will be sharing my source-code when I have some time to figure out Git.</p>
