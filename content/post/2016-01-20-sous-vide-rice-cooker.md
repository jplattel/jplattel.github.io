This has been on my _tinker-list_ for around 4 years, and I've finally got around doing it. I made a little temperature controlled relay to my rice-cooker which enables me to use it as a sous-vide apparatus. That's wonderful, because it's now easier to prepare meat, and most importantly, eat 67 °C eggs. So how did I do it? I bought a really cheap PID [from DealExtreme](http://www.dx.com/p/digital-temperature-controller-66334?r=41389038), and with some help of Martin Deen I had everything set up.

But that's where things got wrong 4 years ago... The PID didn't seem to function properly, I couldn't find a way to calibrate it and I was missing tools and manuals to create a good enclosure for the PID. So I left the project catching dust in a drawer..

Fast-forward to one week ago.. I had 1 day reserved for tinkering (ship it!) and it should be done. I fetched the PID from the drawer and got to work.. Here's a little timelapse: (in better quality than Facebook)

During lunch hour, it seem to work and I rushed to the local supermarket for eggs...  And next day I threw in a large piece of meat:

That meat turned out even better! Now with everything working properly I could focus on creating a nice enclosure for the device. I wanted to have something sturdy and I had some small changes for the electrical circuit. I wanted to keep on using the rice cooker for normal usage as well, so I made plan to make a device with 1 socket in and 1 socket out. This way, both could be a stand-alone device and usable for other things too! So with a bit of woodworking and electrical wire, I made an enclosure:

Now I only need to close it with a bottom plate and add Sugru feet to it. Then it's done! Let's see what other interesting recipes are available for this thing!
