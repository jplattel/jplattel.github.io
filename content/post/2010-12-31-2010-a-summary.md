This year passed with an excellent speed, not to quick, but certainly not slowly. I think pictures say more then words so I would like to share with you every picture I took at [8:36pm](http://www.jplattel.nl/836pm/) during 2010:

(Huge thanks to my brother [Kees](http://www.ikbenke.es) who was so kind to make a video of it!)

Not only did I finish my bachelor degree this year, but I also started Qs Amsterdam and some other [interesting projects](http://www.jplattel.nl/projecten-2010/). I'll try to deliver even more effort and create more achievements into 2011!

During 2010 I have collected way more data that i'm currently shaping into a Annual Report just like [Nicholas Feltron](http://www.feltron.com) does. It should be less artistic but full of interesting bits! I'm building it in Processing, which I just started to learn 4 days ago. Keep an eye on this blog or follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jplattel) when the report is finished!
