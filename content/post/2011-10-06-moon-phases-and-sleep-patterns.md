Even before I got a Zeo, I was wondering if the phases of the moon are of influence of my sleep quality. With [the Zeo](http://myzeo.com) that offers an API, I finally had a chance to investigate. As it turns out after four months of experimenting: the phase of the moon doesn't have any influence on my sleep quality or the time it takes to fall asleep.

I've been building my own interface for the Zeo, because the flash based website doesn't suit my needs, here's a small screenshot:

I plan on rebuilding this on Django, but I'm currently having trouble with MySQL bindings on python... The building of the bindings produces lots of errors. If I can't get it done, maybe I'll have a try at [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
