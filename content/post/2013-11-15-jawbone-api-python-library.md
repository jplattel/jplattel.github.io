I've been wearing a [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up) for the last few months. There are things I like about it, the app, the sleep interface and the options you have for notifications. Some other things I dislike, the 3.5mm jack for syncing for example... It's annoying. They have it solved with [the next version](https://jawbone.com/up) though.

As with all the other devices that I've been wearing I wanted to get the data out of it. And luckily Jawbone offers an API. So that's what I did, and [the code is up on Github](https://github.com/jplattel/PyJawbone/) for you to use and fork.
