As we close out 2018 and start out the new year fresh, the one thing left to do is make a video of all the 8:36pm photos that I took that year. And when uploading this video I checked out when I started, which is 2010. Thus this marks the 10th year that I'm doing this... Here's the video:

Phew, racking in around 3000 photos so far... For all I can say is that I will probably be going somewhere with this.. But who knows where. 

I also started a second habit and that is filing the [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/) together with [Chantal](http://chantalvankempen.nl/). And that's a wonderfull way of reflecting and looking ahead for each year. My goals for this year are focussed on my health, hiking and making things!
