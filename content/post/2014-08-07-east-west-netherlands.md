It's holiday, and I've spend most of my time last month in The Netherlands hiking. From the east to the west, to complement what we did two years ago. And I wanted to share some pictures of my adventure:

In 19 days we hiked over 360 kilometers, staying at farmers, friends, campinggrounds or somewhere else. It was a blast! We'll see where we end up next year! For those interested, the route is called the [Marskramerspad](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marskramerpad).
