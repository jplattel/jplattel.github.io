On 20 september the first [Quantified Self Amsterdam Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/qsamsterdam/) took place in _het volkskrantgebouw_. More then 60 people attended and we had guests from Germany and France! A [full recap](http://quantifiedself.com/) can be found on the main QS blog and the videoâ€™s on [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/qsams). [Sebastiaan ter Burg](http://www.ter-burg.nl/) provided the video/[photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/qsams) capture and [Kees Plattel](http://www.ikbenke.es/) made a wonderful [intro](http://vimeo.com/14967809)!

I really enjoyed this amazing meetup with interesting talks! If you are interested sign up for our meetup group and we will let you know when the next event is! Or do you have a personal story to share, feel free to [contact](http://www.jplattel.nl/contact/) me!
