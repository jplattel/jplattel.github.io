For Quantified Self starters I recommend the really nice [Moves App](https://moves-app.com/). The interface is really nice and the battery drain isn't that bad if you recharge it twice a day. They recently [opened up their API enabling developers](http://dev.moves-app.com) like me to create apps based on their platform. For me the first step towards creating an app is a easier way to communicate with the API.

As with the fitbit, I've written a open-source library for you to use! It's available trough [Github](https://github.com/jplattel/PyMoves). If you want to improve my code, feel free to fork me! I will use this library for creating a website which let's you export all data from Moves more easily. Because freedom of data is important, getting it out is the first step.
