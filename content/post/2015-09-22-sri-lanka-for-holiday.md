Long overdue, but now I have some time to spend writing a blogpost. The previous month I've spend 3 weeks in Sri Lanka! For two weeks, we discovered the island, visiting beaches, jungle, towns and cities. The culture is wonderful and people are very friendly. It's also been a great opportunity to try out some new things, for example dabbling in photography and exploring apps like [VSCO](http://vsco.co/film). In this post, all of the pictures have been shot with a [S-120](http://www.canon.nl/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_camera/powershot/powershot_s120/) and then improved with VSCO.

I've seen lots of temples, stupa's and buddha statues, and the views were nothing short of spectacular. Ranging from wide-views to jungles. We had great weather and over time I've tinkered enough with my camera to get some decent shots.

In the last week, we've stayed at a hotel in Induruwa, close to Bentota. Just 1 night before we left, we went on our last trip to Adam's Peak. A 2300 meter high mountain with 6000 steps to climb. In the middle of the night, we ascended the stairs and we reached the top an hour before sunrise. Sadly for us, the first part of sunrise was cloudy. But it was not long before the clouds cleared and some nice pictures could be made:

While it took us 3,5 hours to reach the top, descending is even harder, but the views you see while coming down are very beautiful! After driving back to the hotel for 5 hours, we could finally relax in the pool! The climb was a perfect finish for our holiday! Looking back, this has been a great adventure!
