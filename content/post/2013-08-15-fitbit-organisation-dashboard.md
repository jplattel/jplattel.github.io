The [Fitbit](http://fitbit.com) is one of the best tools for activity tracking.The interface is nice and the hardware is durable and syncs wirelessly. For a personal level is good, but using group-wise or equipping all employees with a Fitbit turns out to be non-existent.

During the past few days I've spend some time building a dashboard that lets people see the data from all users within a group. It gets all data trough the Fitbit API and summarizes it into a view per day/week/month. Next to that I also plan to provide leaderboards, custom graphs and statistics. Here's a screenshot of the app so far:

A dashboard like this is possibly useful for elderly care homes or organisations that are interested in their employees activity and health. If you have other ideas where this could find a platform, let me know in the comments!
