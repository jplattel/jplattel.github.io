<p>I've been using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> as my go-to framework for the past few months. So far I've enjoyed the ride, but have learned some things that I'd like to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>During project setup, create a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtual environment</a> for yourself to work in. Use the '<em>pip freeze</em>' for creating a requirements.txt that helps you manage dependencies.</li>
<li>Don't use any paths within the views. Instead, use the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/urlresolvers/#reverse">reverse function</a> for looking up routes that correspond to the url. This helps a lot when you run Django in a folder on a server.</li>
<li>Logic should be integrated into models. I'm just getting used to this, but helps creating <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry">DRY</a>-er code. In the next version I will be doing this for most of my dashboard functionalities.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> for your database migrations. It helps moving data around when you change your models during development.</li>
<li><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/alias.html">Alias</a> '<em>python manage.py</em>' to '<em>django</em>' in your bash or zsh config for easy access to functions.</li>
<li>Use different <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-option---settings">settings files</a> for development, staging and production</li>
<li>When deploying, it took me a while to figure out, but it's quite easy to use a virtual environment for your app too. I'm trying to take it one step further by exploring <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>.</li>
</ul>
