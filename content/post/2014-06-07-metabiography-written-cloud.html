<p>Last month, most of my time was spend on a project for <a href="http://yuriveerman.nl/">Yuri Veerman</a> &amp; <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/elsbethfraanje">Elsbeth Fraanje</a>, who are part of the <a href="http://quantifiedreality.nl/">Quantified Reality</a> project by het Mediafonds &amp; the Sandberg Institute. Elsbeth and Yuri are exploring the possiblities of (auto)generating a biography from somebody's meta-data and created the the aptly named Metabiography.</p>
<p>I was asked by Yuri &amp; Elsbeth to build a working prototype For now, it's in pre-beta phase, but below is a screenshot how it could look like. And functions are still changing around as Yuri &amp; Eslbeth tinker on the concept.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/img/Screen-Shot-2014-06-02-at-4.54.20-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3027" src="/img/Screen-Shot-2014-06-02-at-4.54.20-PM-1024x657.png" alt="Metabiography" width="620" height="397" /></a></p>
<p>The idea of something written by algorithms is very interesting to me. Especially if you could tinker with probabilities and variables that make up sentences, sentiment and structure of a story. Could a narrative been created by an algorithm? If <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdf">scientific papers</a> are, I'm sure making a meta-biography should be possible too!</p>
