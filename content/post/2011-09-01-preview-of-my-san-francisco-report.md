For the people who sponsored me for [my trip to San Francisco](http://www.jplattel.nl/san-francisco-2011-qs2011/), I'm building a report inspired my [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com/ar10_01.html) about my trip. I wanted to show you a small preview on the right:

I'm aiming to have at least 4 page worth of data to show you. Since I've never dived deep into Processing, the building time is somewhat extended, so I don't know when it'll be finished. I started studying Media Technology as well, so spare time is a little bit limited.

All my sponsors get the pdf for free, and maybe if I have the time I'll see if I can publish a hard-copy trough [Peecho](http://www.peecho.com/)Â and make it available for download on this website.
