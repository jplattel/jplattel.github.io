title: My effort for a better readinglist

I love the [Read It Later List](http://www.readitlaterlist.com/) service. Each day I save about 20-30 articles from Google Reader or my Twitter client so I can read them later. However, these amounts make it hard for me to process all the things I save. That's why I need a readinglist that has additional filtering/speed/shortcuts.

As my endeavors with Python continue, for the last few months I've been developing my own version of the perfect readinglist build upon the [API of Read It Later List](http://www.readitlaterlist.com/api/).

The name for the project is **Readledo**. And as you've seen in the screenshot, I've added some handy things:

*   Keyboard shortcuts and navigation ((used for adding tags, opening or sending links))
*   Sorting by tags
*   Color-coded tagging ((visual feedback is quicker))
*   Integration with Toodledo, Radbox and more ((based upon access trough email instead of API's because I'm having trouble with OAuth)).
*   (still in development, batch processing)

The project is still in development, but I'm going to open-source it through Github once the code has been improved. In the mean time, do you have any other suggestions that would make a better readinglist?
