I've started tracking my food intake with [Foodzy](http://www.foodzy.com) about 13 days ago. And while doing that I already came across some interesting things. I've never been fully tracking my food intake, but the Foodzy app on my iPhone with extensive database (including typical dutch food) makes it quite easy. I've been tracking for thirteen days now.

The first step I wanted to take is to generate a baseline of my typical food consumption(and thus caloric values), this way I can see where I can make improvements and measure the changes. A few days after I got started I was already more aware of my eating habits and started to make small changes. We'll see where everything ends up, but there's one thing that I would like to share.

I've been thinking about making my data publicly available through a CSV-file generate by Google Docs. But until I've got everything working, here's a temporary graph to enjoy:

The [spreadsheet with data in available trough Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnB8kqWnEJuQdFVhb09PQWx0Nmt2bGdVMTB2RzVuTmc&hl=en_US), please read the notes in the second sheet as well, because I'm searching for a reason for the differences.
