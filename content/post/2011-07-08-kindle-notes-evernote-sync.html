<p><a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/img/Evernote1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2114 alignright" title="evernote-to-kindle" src="/img/Evernote1.png" alt="evernote-to-kindle" width="202" height="230" /></a>Since I got my Kindle I started reading a lot more books and articles. And one of the nice things you can do is add notes and clip certain pieces of text. The Kindle saves all those things into a text file for easy access, but I wanted those to be searchable as well in my system.</p>
<p>I wrote a small python script that extracts all notes and clippings from the text file and creates a new note in Evernote for each of them. It's quite crappy python, but at least my skills are improving a bit. You can find the <a href="https://gist.github.com/1071682">source-code on this gist</a>.</p>
<p><em>The only thing you need to do is save this python script, put the "My Clippings.txt" in the same folder and run the script with Evernote open. It will create a new Evernote-note for each note on your Kindle with the tag Kindle.</em></p>
<p>Next version will be fully sync fully automatically and remember which notes are already synchronized. Stay tuned!</p>
