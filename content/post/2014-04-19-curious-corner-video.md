I've curated 6 editions of [the Curious Corner of the Internet](http://jplattel.nl/corner) until this day. It started out as an experiment of just showing my saved-for-later links in a presentation.

Thanks to [Daan](http://www.videologic.nl/) for the video. The next talk might be at [Permanent Beta day](http://www.meetup.com/PermanentBeta/events/162113042/) on the 30th of June.
