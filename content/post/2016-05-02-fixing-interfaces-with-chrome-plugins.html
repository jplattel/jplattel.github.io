<p>Online services tend to change their functionality or interaction. Sometimes in a good way, other times in a bad way. Most recently LinkedIn made a little change in the way accepting (and replying to) invites works. I personally use LinkedIn as a address book and leave it alone at times, never inviting people but combing trough the invites. I used to reply with a text-expander snippet too see if a connection is valuable, but this seemed to be impossible lately.</p>
<p>Turns out, I wasn't the only one and Martijn actually wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-linkedin-please-dont-make-me-quit-your-services-martijn-aslander?trk=prof-post">a bigger post</a> on the problem. Ofcourse asking LinkedIn is the best way of complaining, but fixing it probably would take them a long time (if they decide to!). So I made a little chrome plugin that easily opens up to 10 new tabs all with a conversation without navigating through hovers and popups.</p>
<p>The plugin is seriously alpha software and way to loose configured, but I put it up <a href="https://github.com/jplattel/linkedin-invite-opener">on Github</a> so anyone can use it! <em>Disclaimer: I provide no support at all, if you still want it, find someone who can help you!Â </em></p>
