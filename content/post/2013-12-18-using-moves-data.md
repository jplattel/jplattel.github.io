In July I wrote [a little wrapper for the Moves App API](http://www.jplattel.nl/python-library-moves-app-api/). But I didn't develop the ideas I had for it any further due to time constraints. But other projects got me into it and I wanted to share what I'm currently Â building. I've drawn the same concept of a fitbit dashboard over to a Moves Dashboard, so we can use the same data. And I've got some friends who come up with great ideas too! Thanks to [Mike](http://mikeverbruggen.nl/), I'm explore the possiblity of using Moves to log car-mileage.

So far I've been able to put everything in a database and run range queries on it:

Other ideas and subprojects might include: predictive algorithms, calendar feeds, auto foursquare checkins or kml and mass-export. If you have any other ideas, share them in the comments, I might build it!

**Edit:** Got a calender feed working, but it's a bit overkill:
