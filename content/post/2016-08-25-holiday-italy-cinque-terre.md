This summer I spend 2 weeks in Italy together with [Chantal](http://chantalvankempen.nl/). We started off in Rome, spending our time in Trastevere. We visited all the main tourist attractions, because I hadn't visited Rome before. Time passed by pretty quickly and we traveled to Florence by BlaBlaCar. After a day of traveling, it's great to jump in a pool!

Florence is an amazing city, especially when you can watch the sun set over the city, the food is good and if you dive a bit into Italian culture you'll find hidden gems! Next up was San Gimigniano, a little town with lots of towers. We stayed in an [agriturismo](http://agriturismo.it) for 1 night, I cannot recommend this enough if you are somewhere in Tuscania. We visited Pisa before going to La Spezia, which would be our take off point for the main goal of our trip: Cinque Terre.

Cinque Terre is series of villages at the waterfront of Liguria, and I'd like to show you one image for every village:

The last two days we're spend at the beach of Lido di Camaiore and Lucca. Holiday well spend I would say! Italy, I'll be back for more.
