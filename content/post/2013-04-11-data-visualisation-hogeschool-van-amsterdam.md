Together with [Heinze](http://heinzehavinga.nl/) I've guided and taught several students from the [Hogeschool van Amsterdam](http://www.hva.nl/) about data and data-visualisation. In 3 days packed with GPS-trackers, stories, examples and code we've made some interesting visualisations.

Some were shown in Carre during the education conference organised by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. Thanks [Captain Video](http://www.captainvideo.nl/) for the awesome setup with a cube:

Ofcourse I've also made my own data-visualisation. The data consists of minute-by-minute data available trough the Fitbit data API. This data is stored in a simple CSV file and visualised with D3, my favorite SVG library for visualisations, the result is a canvas with triangles related to the Hogeschool itself:
