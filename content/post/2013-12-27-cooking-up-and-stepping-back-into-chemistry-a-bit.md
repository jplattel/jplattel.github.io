I made a small visit to Paris at the start of November and I had the opportunity to visit the Lab Store. I've read about the concept in a book called The Lab that I've bought during my first visit to San Francisco. It's just pure luck that I come across that book in a little bookstore, but it feels like the adventure is just about to start..

While visiting [the Lab Store](http://labstore-paris.com) I had to buy one of the Le Whaf's. It's sold out in the webstore, but I'm just too much into chemistry and cooking to let it go.

Now, I just need some time to calibrate my sous-vide rice cooker:
