[SETUP](http://setup.nl/) is holding a [competition](http://elegant.setup.nl/) to get programming known as modern day craftwork. I whole-fully agree to this and decided to enter the contest!

With a small part of my time spend while traveling I and finally finishing up I've gotten [my last version up and running](http://www.jplattel.nl/mondriaantje/). I use javascript and D3 (SVG) for drawing the elements as this is a library that I wanted to explore. The ease of use and adoption rate of it made a good starting point for me to quickly get to a result. Without further ado, here's my version of [Victory Boogie-Woogie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Boogie-Woogie), but instead of inspired by a song, you manually input a text-string like a name:

The code for the entire artwork is [on Github](https://github.com/jplattel/Mondriaantje) and MIT-licensed, feel free to play around with it!
