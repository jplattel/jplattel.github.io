A few weeks agoÂ I gave a lecture in Ghent, a beautiful city and so I decided to spend the weekend at an AirBnB host to enjoy the city! Here's a picture I took:

I've uploaded all the slides from the lecture on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/jsplattel/slideshelf) for you to enjoy. It was my longest lecture and I've learned some useful things while doing so. I find that having a storyline with little pieces is harder to keep up over longer times, so next time I will try to venture more in depth of some of my personal tracking experiments, for example my [phone usage](www.jplattel.nl/quantified-phone-usage-ipython/).
