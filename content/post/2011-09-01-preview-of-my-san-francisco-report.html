<p><a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/img/SF-Report.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2150" title="SF Report" src="/img/SF-Report.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="354" /></a>For the people who sponsored me for <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/san-francisco-2011-qs2011/">my trip to San Francisco</a>, I'm building a report inspired my <a href="http://feltron.com/ar10_01.html">Nicholas Felton</a> about my trip. I wanted to show you a small preview on the right:</p>
<p>I'm aiming to have at least 4 page worth of data to show you. Since I've never dived deep into Processing, the building time is somewhat extended, so I don't know when it'll be finished. I started studying Media Technology as well, so spare time is a little bit limited.</p>
<p>All my sponsors get the pdf for free, and maybe if I have the time I'll see if I can publish a hard-copy trough <a href="http://www.peecho.com/">Peecho</a>Â and make it available for download on this website.</p>
