<p>At the third <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Palo-Alto-2012/">Quantified Self Conference</a> in Stanford last week I gave a talk about Plugin Heuristcs, a term that describes something I've come across during my years of self-tracking experiments. Here are the slides:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14426195?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;page=upload" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="476" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p>Plugin Heuristics confines an architecture that I propose for self-tracking things with a side-effect. For example when tracking my food intake for at least a month, it changed the way my brain remembers all the things I've eaten. When I got started I could barely remember one day of intake, when a month has passed, your memory for food specific things increases to almost a week.</p>
<p>The slides illustrate some of the things I wanted to talk about, but the main question here is: did you experience the same or other side-effects? If so, how could you put this to use? </p>
