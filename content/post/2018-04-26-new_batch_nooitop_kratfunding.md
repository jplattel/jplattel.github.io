Past week we spend a day at a brewery! We made a new batch for our brewery <a href="http://brouwerijnooitgedacht.nl">Nooitgedacht</a>. We improved our recipe of our tripel and you can now fund our brewery buy pre-ordering a crate of beer trough <a href="//kratfunding.nl">Kratfunding</a>, we only ship to the Netherlands currently!

Our plan is to use Kratfunding in a way to organise enough money to be self-sufficient as a brewery. And as an organization we want to enable more homebrewers to scale up more easily.  

Here's a picture of the kettles we used to brew our beer. <img src="/img/b.jpg" alt=""> If everything goes according to plan we will have our beer ready in about 6 weeks!
