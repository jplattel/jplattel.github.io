Last year I gave a little talk at the Cross Media Cafe in Hilversum. Happily afterwards I gave a little interview and people took a few photos. This year started pretty nice with some media coverage, but at the end of february a book landed in the mail:  

![Book: Trends en Ontwikkeling in de Crossmedia](/img/10157012_10201917506443299_729360140_n.jpg)

I made a scan of the page and it's [available on Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/211599572/Cross-Media-Cafe-Apps-Data-Joost-Plattel). And together with the working group of patient generated data, we've written a white paper about the data that persons generate that healthcare could use. I [put it up on Scribd too](http://www.scribd.com/doc/214276409/Zelfmetingen-en-de-Nederlandse-Gezondheidszorg). I'm planning on publishing more!
