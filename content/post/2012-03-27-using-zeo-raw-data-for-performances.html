<p>Together with <a href="http://ikbenke.es">my brother</a> I run a <a href="http://hoofdbeelden.nl/">little experiment called Hoofdbeelden</a>. It's a exploration for both of us as an artist and how we can use data generated by me as a person can be used for audio/visual performances. We've had a few gigs so far, but our last at <a href="http://www.fiberfestival.nl/">Fiber Festival</a> certainly made sure for the both of us that this is something we want to do.</p>
<p>In short Hoofdbeelden is a system which allows us tap into devices hooked onto my body for real-time information. I wrote a little piece of software which reads all different kinds of devices and outputs OSC (Open Sound Control) messages so my brother can use those for visuals.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For now our visuals are done in Touch Designer, which limits us to windows. And we're also trying to hook up more data-streams. But the Zeo proved to be the most useful so far. John Amschler did the upgrade for me and kindly handed me his cable. With a bit of trouble I was able to read the raw data of a COM port on windows, and within 10 minutes I could push all data straight trough a OSC-channel. Which not only meant useful data back to my brother, but realtime bio-feedback on my iPad trough TouchOSC as well! Five sliders or knobs based on brainwave frequencies!</p>
<p>A quick gist to get the basics going:</p>

<p>Now, onto the heart-rate and other biorhythms!</p>
