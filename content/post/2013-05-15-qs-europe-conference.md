I've spend past weekend enjoying what I do most, submerge in a community driven event, to come out two days later sleep deprived but full with ideas and enthusiasm. As one of the organisers of the conference you might think that it's a though thing to do, coordinating it all, but with a wonderful group of people from america and the [QS Amsterdam](http://meetup.com/qsamsterdam/) team it was a blast!

The atmosphere of the group was really great and we had almost 300 people at the venue. Over 30% of the people contributed to the conference by giving talks, demo's or office hours! The things I liked the most were the breakout session by [Bodymedia](http://www.bodymedia.com/), sensors by [op-innovations](http://op-innovations.com), [the talk by Buster Benson](http://bit.ly/qseu13-836) and the time I had to talk to other people.

[Fastmovingtargets](http://www.fastmovingtargets.nl) also interviewed people on the spot and have created a quick overview of the broad perspective QS offers, you can [watch all the interviews at their website](http://fastmovingtargets.nl/2013/05/14/quantified-self-van-samen-afvallen-tot-oneindig-leven/).
