<p>During the QS Conference the <a href="http://www.myzeo.com/">awesome guys from Zeo</a> gifted me one of their sleep monitors. And 1 week ago it arrived by mail. I promised to create as much value in return if I liked the Zeo. And I do, I absolutely do. Here is why:</p>
<p>As an average person sleep 8 hours a day you spend 1/3 of your life lying in bed... That's a lot of time spend. The Zeo provides me with a much detailed insight into how my sleep and dreams progress during the night. My sleep is quite good, but I could never figure out how many times I awoke during the night or how much rem-sleep I got, but now I do.</p>

<p>Even more awesome: they have an <a href="http://blog.myzeo.com/zeo-open-api/">open API</a> where you can find all your data and even provide a short manual for hacking the device into real-time data processing as well. This is exactly why I wrote the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/02/data-portability/">data-portability</a> post on the main QS blog. These options give the users the power to create their own reports and run their own analytics. I can't wait for some free time to explore this as I want to share some of my data.</p>
<p>Loaded with self-tracking stuff right now... I got my social stream mapped and now turning into body analytics and maybe even back to GPS-tracking. Most likely that I end up as a cyborg in the following years, we will see..</p>
