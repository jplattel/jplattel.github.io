  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: The Curious Corner started as an experimental talk about
    my reading list, but it evolved into a newsletter, but here's a video of a new
    talk!

<p>I've curated 6 editions of <a href="http://jplattel.nl/corner">the Curious Corner of the Internet</a> until this day. It started out as an experiment of just showing my saved-for-later links in a presentation. The newsletter essentially was a second format, and I didn't explore my chances for a talk much further. Until now, during the Week for the Entrepreneur in the Netherlands, that I'd give it another shot. Sadly, it's in dutch, but here's the video:</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.videologic.nl/">Daan</a> for the video. The next talk might be at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PermanentBeta/events/162113042/">Permanent Beta day</a> on the 30th of June.</p>
