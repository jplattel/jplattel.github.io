I've been walking around with a newsletter idea for some months now. It all started at [Permanent Beta](http://www.permanentbeta.nl) where I gave a talk together with my [twin](http://ikbenke.es). Basically it wasn't really a talk, just a roadshow of awesome stuff we come across on our daily surf on the web. The audience loved it! Why not curate this content into a newsletter?

That's just what I did with [The Curious Corner of the Internet](http://curiouscorner.nl/), a monthly newsletter stocked with the stuff I find during that last month. However, curating would have taken a lot of my time if I didn't find a way to manage it all. Coding to the rescue! A small Node.js app and bookmarklet for Chrome (or extension even) and within 2 hours I had a basic management system running. ([code is up on github](https://github.com/jplattel/curious-corner)!)

I've send out the first edition at the beginning of this month and got another one lined up in a few days? Curious what it'll bring? You can sign up [here](http://jplattel.nl/corner) or in the sidebar next to this blogpost.

Next step: connecting the digital and physical worlds together, so if you have a place where I can share some of my daily reading material, [let me know](http://jplattel.nl/contact)! Also, improving the code-base, adding a sufficient database and connecting it to [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) and send my email directly from my system.
