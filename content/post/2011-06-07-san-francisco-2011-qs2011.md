[![Joost @ Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco](/img/IMG_2559-300x300.jpg "Joost @ Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco")](http://www.jplattel.nl/img/IMG_2559.jpg) On the 25th of may my trip started with a 11 hour long flight straight [to San Francisco to visit the Quantified Self Conference](http://www.jplattel.nl/amerika/) in Mountain View. The trip was funded by donations, ideas and people.

Together with [Martijn Aslander](https://twitter.com/#!/resourcerer) I've spent the first few days as a tourist and visited most of the spots that represent San Francisco. Then we boarded the Caltrain for Mountain View.

I volunteered at the the conference which brought me way more then being just there as a guest. I met a lot of wonderful and amazing people that would understand your point of view and knowledge about the Quantified Self. I may write a separate blogpost about the conference but there are great writeups [by](http://qswiki.com/index.php/QS_Conference_2011) [other](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/31/highlights-of-the-first-quantified-self-conference/) [people](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/category/quantified-self-2011/).

The day after the conference we took a short tour past Apple, Google & LinkedIn, took the Caltrain back and explored the center of San Francisco, ending with a diner at the [Top of the Mark](http://www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/top_of_the_mark/), a magnificent view!

Tuesday we visited Berkeley, to visit [Gary Wolf](http://aether.com/) and spend some time shopping for gadgets that had been on our wishlist. We had our last dinner in SF together with [Eva Rijser](http://www.twitter.com/evarijser) who arranged space for us during the first two days.

And on wednesday we had a quick breakfast before taking the BART to the airport once again. Jetlag got me once, but luckily the recovery went quite well.

In summary: I loved San Francisco! And a big thank you to [all the people that made this trip possible](http://www.jplattel.nl/amerika/)! I'm gonna build somekind of report just like Nicholas Felton did but just about the visit to the US.
