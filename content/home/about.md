# Hello!

Iâ€™m __Joost Plattel__, a data-strategist. I help organizations and individuals develop and build strategies for data-related questions and opportunities. <br />I connect _API's_, work with _large datasets, models or visualizations_. All to solve these question, discover patterns or explore new opportunities. 

The main question I try to answer is:

<blockquote>
	How do we turn all the data we have available into information, to knowledge and finally wisdom. Can we use if for good?
</blockquote>

My clients range from startups to the government, large organisations or individuals. People recommend my for my unique combination of curiousity with applied solutions. Wondering what else I do?
