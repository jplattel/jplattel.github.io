# Hello!

Iâ€™m Joost Plattel, a data-strategist. I help organizations and individuals develop and build strategies for data-related questions and opportunities. I create _experimental models, data visualizations, APIs and dashboards_ to solve these questions or explore the opportunities. 

The question I try to answer is:

<blockquote>
	How do we use all the data generated every second? How do we turn it into information, to knowledge and finally wisdom?
</blockquote>

I'm often asked to give lectures and talks about data, experiments, ethics and difficult or weird questions to make people think. My clients range from startups to the government, large organisations or individuals. Wondering what other people say? Check out my <a href="#media">publications and media</a>. For other things, have a look at my other <a href="#projects">projects</a> I run and subscribe to <a href="/project/curious_corner/">my monthly newsletter</a>!
