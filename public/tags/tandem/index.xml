      <description>i&#39;ve been on holiday for most the past month. The urge to travel has been growing since a few years, and this year I&#39;ve been to several new cities in Europe. After the QS Conference in San Francisco in June, I came back, only to pack my bags once again to hop on a bus to Denmark. My father organises a yearly travel group to the Haervejsmarchen. Together with Chantal we joined him!</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago I left the small village of Sloten in The Netherlands with a lofty goal, to reach Rome in Italy. On a tandem bicycle with a friend.
A total distance around 2300km was meant to be covered. In the fourth day, we left the Netherlands and went into Germany.. Traveling trough the Ruhr area and cycling next to the Rhine.
Next, the Swabian Jura and with 2 weeks we covered most of Germany.</description>
