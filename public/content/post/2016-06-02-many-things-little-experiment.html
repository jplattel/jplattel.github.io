<p>On the 14th of March 2016 I gave a short talk at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tedxyouthgroningen/">TEDxYouth Groningen</a>, and the video is finally online! I've embedded the video below, it's in dutch but I'm sure the subtitles will be available shortly. My talk is about the all the photos I took so far at 8:36pm. I started without any specific reason, but found out that you could figure it out while doing it as well. I've collected over 5 years of photos and I don't plan on quitting any time soon.</p>
