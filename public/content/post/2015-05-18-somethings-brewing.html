<p>And it's beer! Well it's stored now and bubbling away! Yesterday afternoon I've brewed my first batch of beer. With the gear and knowledge of a friend, we manufactured 48 liters of pale ale. The sunny afternoon also was a perfect opportunity for my new camera, so I took some tests shots. Here's the brewery in my backyard:<br />

Sadly the coriander seeds got lost and we skipped those. Hopefully the taste will turn out great! First tasting was pretty good! Here we are happy with the progress:<br />

Some more pictures will follow with the end result, keep you posted! </p>
