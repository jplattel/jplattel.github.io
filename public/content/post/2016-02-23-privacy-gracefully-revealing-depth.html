<p>Just a couple of days ago I read <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/6-secret-bitbucket-features/?categories=git">a post from Atlassian</a> explaining some new features, but the most interesting aspect was that they explore gracefully revealing depth. To me this same concept can also be applied to privacy, ethics and moreÂ problems. Even though it's about functionality, the same can be applied to complexity.</p>
<p>As we are faced with interesting problems about privacy and ethics, would the way of gracefully revealing complexity work for making the right choices or settings the right parameters? I think it does, and that's why I started building <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/gradual-privacy-personal-data/">gradual privacy</a>, but it doesn't end there, the other way around is also fascinating, as some functions might not be thought of beforehand. This relates to privacy and <a href="http://www.jplattel.nl/musings-on-transparency/">transparency</a> even more, could we cover all scenarios with these depths? Or how deep are these depths?</p>
