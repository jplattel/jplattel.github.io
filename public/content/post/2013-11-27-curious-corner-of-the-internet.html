<p>I've been walking around with a newsletter idea for some months now. It all started at <a href="http://www.permanentbeta.nl">Permanent Beta</a> where I gave a talk together with my <a href="http://ikbenke.es">twin</a>. Basically it wasn't really a talk, just a roadshow of awesome stuff we come across on our daily surf on the web. The audience loved it! Why not curate this content into a newsletter?</p>
<p>That's just what I did with <a href="http://jplattel.nl/corner/">The Curious Corner of the Internet</a>, a monthly newsletter stocked with the stuff I find during that last month. However, curating would have taken a lot of my time if I didn't find a way to manage it all. Coding to the rescue! A small Node.js app and bookmarklet for Chrome (or extension even) and within 2 hours I had a basic management system running. (<a href="https://github.com/jplattel/curious-corner">code is up on github</a>!)</p>

<p>I've send out the first edition at the beginning of this month and got another one lined up in a few days? Curious what it'll bring? You can sign up <a href="http://jplattel.nl/corner">here</a> or in the sidebar next to this blogpost.</p>
<p>Next step: connecting the digital and physical worlds together, so if you have a place where I can share some of my daily reading material, <a href="http://jplattel.nl/contact">let me know</a>! Also, improving the code-base, adding a sufficient database and connecting it to <a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> and send my email directly from my system.</p>
