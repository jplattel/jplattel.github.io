I've spend past weekend enjoying what I do most, submerge in a community driven event, to come out two days later sleep deprived but full with ideas and enthusiasm. As one of the organisers of the conference you might think that it's a though thing to do, coordinating it all, but with a wonderful group of people from america and the <a href="http://meetup.com/qsamsterdam/">QS Amsterdam</a> team it was a blast!</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the group was really great and we had almost 300 people at the venue. Over 30% of the people contributed to the conference by giving talks, demo's or office hours! The things I liked the most were the breakout session by <a href="http://www.bodymedia.com/">Bodymedia</a>, sensors by <a href="http://op-innovations.com">op-innovations</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/qseu13-836">the talk by Buster Benson</a> and the time I had to talk to other people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastmovingtargets.nl">Fastmovingtargets</a> also interviewed people on the spot and have created a quick overview of the broad perspective QS offers, you can <a href="http://fastmovingtargets.nl/2013/05/14/quantified-self-van-samen-afvallen-tot-oneindig-leven/">watch all the interviews at their website</a>.</p>
