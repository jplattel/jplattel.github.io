<p>Facebook recently released <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/prophet/">Prophet</a>, a library that makes it easy to create predictions based on time-series data. When the time was right to tinker around, I thought of a dataset I've been collecting for some time now, which is the smart energy meter we have for our house.</p>

<p>And with some tinkering to get Prophet to play nice with my containers and Jupyter I had my first prediction in a few minutes: </p>

<p>This makes me wonder if I could just pay the predicted amount instead of a fixed fee... but that's probably not feasible on the provider side. Other datasets that I might look at: amount of calendar items (to predict future busy-ness), activity or heart-rate (could I really?). Or maybe parking fines prediction? I got a sample dataset of a year of parking fines, mmh?</p>
