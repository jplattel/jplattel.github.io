<p>A few weeks agoÂ I gave a lecture in Ghent, a beautiful city and so I decided to spend the weekend at an AirBnB host to enjoy the city! Here's a picture I took:<br />
<img class=" size-full wp-image-3405 aligncenter" src="/img/IMG_6578.jpg" alt="IMG_6578.jpg" width="7976" height="3918" /><br />
I've uploaded all the slides from the lecture on Slideshare for you to enjoy.<br />
<iframe class="size-full aligncenter" style="border: none;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/jsplattel/slideshelf" width="490px" height="470px" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
It was my longest lecture and I've learned some useful things while doing so. I find that having a storyline with little pieces is harder to keep up over longer times, so next time I will try to venture more in depth of some of my personal tracking experiments, for example my <a href="www.jplattel.nl/quantified-phone-usage-ipython/">phone usage</a>.</p>
