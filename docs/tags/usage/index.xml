      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technology is making it easier to collect data, for example phone usage. From the 1st of January I tracked how much I&#39;ve used my phone by installing an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-track-how-much-you/id771541926?mt=8&#34;&gt;Moment&lt;/a&gt;. It runs in the background and silently tracks how much you use your phone. As said, the first step towards behaviour-change is providing insight in current behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been exploring iPython for data-analysis and sharing snippets of data. I&#39;ve started a Github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jplattel/notebooks&#34;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that contains some notebooks I&#39;m working on. And I&#39;ve embedded the one below where I analyse my phone usage:</description>

      <title>Learning about power-usage data from my home</title>

      <description>I recently moved to a new home, and I got a freshly installed new electricity meter that&#39;s a little bit more intelligent. It was now possible for me to sign up for slimmemeterportal.nl, that let&#39;s you access the power-usage data from the meter by a 15 minute window.Â That&#39;s quite some data to play with!
Being interested in the data, I wrote a little scraper that collects it for me and stores it in a SQL database, from there on, with Flask and Peewee it was quite simple to create a little API for my own dataset.</description>
