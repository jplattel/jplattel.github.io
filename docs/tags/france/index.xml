      <description>i&#39;ve been on holiday for most the past month. The urge to travel has been growing since a few years, and this year I&#39;ve been to several new cities in Europe. After the QS Conference in San Francisco in June, I came back, only to pack my bags once again to hop on a bus to Denmark. My father organises a yearly travel group to the Haervejsmarchen. Together with Chantal we joined him!</description>
