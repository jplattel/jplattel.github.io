      <description>In July I wrote a little wrapper for the Moves App API. But I didn&#39;t develop the ideas I had for it any further due to time constraints. But other projects got me into it and I wanted to share what I&#39;m currently building. I&#39;ve drawn the same concept of a fitbit dashboard over to a Moves Dashboard, so we can use the same data. And I&#39;ve got some friends who come up with great ideas too!</description>

      <description>For Quantified Self starters I recommend the really nice Moves App. The interface is really nice and the battery drain isn&#39;t that bad if you recharge it twice a day. They recently opened up their API enabling developers like me to create apps based on their platform. For me the first step towards creating an app is a easier way to communicate with the API.
As with the fitbit, I&#39;ve written a open-source library for you to use!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So much projects, so little time... But hey, let&#39;s just use some of my spare time for keeping you guys updated on the stuff I do. I&#39;ve been doing several things, but the most interesting right now is a new iPhone app concept that we&#39;ve been developing since last month. Together with Nils Waanders and Willemijn Edens we are creating an app which helps people save water while showering. It&#39;s called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.showertrack.com/&#34;&gt;Showertrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we are building Showertrack is an excellent example on how to create something in a more freeform way, or lean if you want to call it that way. We don&#39;t seem to have office hours or office space. We are however supported by people like &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/arjanharing&#34;&gt;Arjan Haring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mattwallaert&#34;&gt;Matt Wallaert&lt;/a&gt;. Utrecht Inc. also lends us space for creative processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is coming along nicely, we&#39;re done with our first wireframes, have a look below:</description>
