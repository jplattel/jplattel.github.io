      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I spend 2 weeks in Italy together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://chantalvankempen.nl/&#34;&gt;Chantal&lt;/a&gt;. We started off in Rome, spending our time in Trastevere. We visited all the main tourist attractions, because I hadn&#39;t visited Rome before. Time passed by pretty quickly and we traveled to Florence by BlaBlaCar. After a day of traveling, it&#39;s great to jump in a pool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence is an amazing city, especially when you can watch the sun set over the city, the food is good and if you dive a bit into Italian culture you&#39;ll find hidden gems! Next up was San Gimigniano, a little town with lots of towers. We stayed in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://agriturismo.it&#34;&gt;agriturismo&lt;/a&gt; for 1 night, I cannot recommend this enough if you are somewhere in Tuscania. We visited Pisa before going to La Spezia, which would be our take off point for the main goal of our trip: Cinque Terre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinque Terre is series of villages at the waterfront of Liguria, and I&#39;d like to show you one image for every village:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&#39;ve been on a little holiday!The destination was Moniga del Garda, Italy. And I&#39;ve shot some great panorama&#39;s that I wanted to share with you:
This summer I&#39;m visiting Sri Lanka and I bought a little pocket camera to help me with some better pictures. I chose the S120, because of Neistat.</description>

      <description>Just two quick bits of newsworthy stuff I wanted to share with you since I got back from Italy (which was really wonderful!):
I gave a small interview about big-data for the dutch television programme Bedrijf in Beeld. Quite happy with the result:

Also, we reached the local dutch newspaper De Spits. The Quantified Self was mentioned by the Rode Kater, a famous little comic:</description>
