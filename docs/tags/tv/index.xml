      <description>Two months ago I spent some time before a camera for a documentary series of the VPRO. The series is called The Perfect Human and explores how technology helps us create a better being. My project with Colliers: The Quantified Workplace is highlighted in the interview. You can watch it online here.
At the end of the past year, I spend an afternoon at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, to contribute towards a document about e-Health.</description>

      <description>Last week I&#39;ve spend some time before camera lenses. On wednesday I got a call for an interview for RTL Nieuws about CES and wearables. A quick interview got me 2 minutes of fame (on from 18:10) on television. On thursday, a longer interview for Arte TV, that will be shown later this month (viewable online too).</description>

      <description>Just two quick bits of newsworthy stuff I wanted to share with you since I got back from Italy (which was really wonderful!):

      <description>On sunday evening, the VPRO aired a new episode of Labyrint, a show for popular science. This episode included coverage of the Quantified Self and an interview with me (in dutch)! I&#39;ve included the video for you to watch below:
