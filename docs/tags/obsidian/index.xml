      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just published my first plugin for Obsidian! As a huge fan of the software the possibility of writing your own plugins to work with the data you create is just awesome! I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for over 8 months now and one of the first things I created was the clipper.
Since a few months Obsidian now allows users to write plugins in Typescript. While I&amp;rsquo;m not that versed in the Typescript/Javascript verse I did manage to write my first plugin!</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m quite a heavy user of Obsidian I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of my scripts I&amp;rsquo;ve written for it. Please note that all of the scripts make use of Keyboard Meastro as a way to activate them and some of them use javascript automation within Mac OS X. So it&amp;rsquo;s Apple only for now.
Within Obsidian I&amp;rsquo;m keeping a folder in which there are files that are used as a templates.</description>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a system which would augment my own thinking with the help of the computer. One of the main promises of a digital life is things could more efficient. Or easily shareable and more resilient (Once you have backups..). For a meriad of reasons the switch should be obvious but for the most of us, that&amp;rsquo;s not what we experience. Why is that?
I started of with just Word documents in folders.</description>
