      <description>On the second of January 2010 I started shooting a picture everyday at 8:36pm, inspired by Buster Benson. Curiosity brought me into it, and if people asked me why I often could not give a sufficient answer. As if it were a form of art.
But now I often wonder about history... How people lived and how further back you go, the less we remember or can find. Technology nowadays could help us bring a more complete image to our future.</description>
