<p>
  I'm often asked for a lecture or as a public speaker on topics like the Quantified Self, data, the Internet of Things and any related fields. If you're curious about the content, have a look at my slides on <a href="http://slideshare.net/jsplattel">Slideshare</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/63226010">look at the video from my talk at Cross Media Cafe</a>. The length varies, depending on the time available I'm able to accommodate ideas in 10 minutes, or an in-depth view of the field in 45 minutes or more.</p>

<h4>What other people say about me:</h4>
<blockquote><p>Joost Plattel is a very enthousiastic and motivated speaker, a ambassador of the Quantified Self community. ~ <strong>Erdinç Saçan</strong>, <em>Marketingfacts</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Joost can't get enough of his own data. His story about the possibilities with the Quantified Self is fascinating and makes you wonder. ~ <strong>Chris van 't Hof</strong>, <em>Tek-Tok</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>Bonus!</h4>
<p>A nerdy bonus if you provide a list of attendees, I might be able to mine some profiles to suit the talk better. <a href="http://jplattel.nl/contact">Get in touch</a> to explore the possibilities!</p>
