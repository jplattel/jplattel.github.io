      <description>A few weeks agoÂ I gave a lecture in Ghent, a beautiful city and so I decided to spend the weekend at an AirBnB host to enjoy the city! Here&#39;s a picture I took:
I&#39;ve uploaded all the slides from the lecture on Slideshare for you to enjoy.

It was my longest lecture and I&#39;ve learned some useful things while doing so. I find that having a storyline with little pieces is harder to keep up over longer times, so next time I will try to venture more in depth of some of my personal tracking experiments, for example my phone usage.</description>

      <description>Technology is making it easier to collect data, for example phone usage. From the 1st of January I tracked how much I&#39;ve used my phone by installing an app called Moment. It runs in the background and silently tracks how much you use your phone. As said, the first step towards behaviour-change is providing insight in current behaviour. Lately I&#39;ve been exploring iPython for data-analysis and sharing snippets of data. I&#39;ve started a Github repository that contains some notebooks I&#39;m working on.</description>
