      <description>This has been on my tinker-list for around 4 years, and I&#39;ve finally got around doing it. I made a little temperature controlled relay to my rice-cooker which enables me to use it as a sous-vide apparatus. That&#39;s wonderful, because it&#39;s now easier to prepare meat, and most importantly, eat 67 °C eggs. So how did I do it? I bought a really cheap PID from DealExtreme, and with some help of Martin Deen I had everything set up.</description>

      <description>I made a small visit to Paris at the start of November and I had the opportunity to visit the Lab Store. I&#39;ve read about the concept in a book called The Lab that I&#39;ve bought during my first visit to San Francisco. It&#39;s just pure luck that I come across that book in a little bookstore, but it feels like the adventure is just about to start..
While visiting the Lab Store I had to buy one of the Le Whaf&#39;s.</description>
