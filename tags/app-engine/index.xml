      <description>I use Read It Later for saving webpages, but if those pages contained video&#39;s I had to visit the webpages, load the video etcetera... It simply does not fulfill my needs for watching video...
While searching Google I discovered RadBox, which does exactly what I want: use a bookmarklet to save video&#39;s to watch later. They offered an API and RSS-feed of my video&#39;s so I decided to build my own based on App Engine.</description>

      <description>I am trying to publish my blogposts in English to reach a wider public. However since English is my second language please forgive me my spelling errors.
Since reading about self-tracking I was fascinated by GPS location and geospatial analysis. As it turns out â€¦. experiments had been done before and I wanted to experience what you could do with the data.

I wondered if it were possible for me recreate this, using my less then basic programming skills and no more utilities then my iPhone.</description>
