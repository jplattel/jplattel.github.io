      <description>When I arrived home this weekend, a small package was waiting for me. It included the Talking20 metabolite kit I&#39;d pre-ordered. And tonight I finally got around of donating some of my blood to the spot card. The package included, 3 spot cards and envelopes, and for each spot-card: an alcohol wipe, bandage and 3 lancets.

It&#39;s quick and easy to get started, but I also got some helpful assistance from my mother :).</description>

      <description>During the QS Conference the awesome guys from Zeo gifted me one of their sleep monitors. And 1 week ago it arrived by mail. I promised to create as much value in return if I liked the Zeo.Â And I do, I absolutely do. Here is why:
As an average person sleep 8 hours a day you spend 1/3 of your life lying in bed... That&#39;s a lot of time spend.</description>

      <description>This week I travelled to Brussels so I could give a talk at the Quantified Self Meetup group there. And I&#39;ve been involved in the startup Scanadu which is about broadcasting your health. Together with people like Walter de Brouwer and Misha Chellam we are going to take a different approach to health. During my stay in Brussels I&#39;ve learned a lot (including my level of French, it&#39;s really bad!). Really liked the city though!</description>
